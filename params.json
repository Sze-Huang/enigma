That is, the same key was used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Anyone with this key would be able to encode and decode messages.\r\n\r\nThis key was constructed by three different parts of the enigma machine.\r\n\r\nThese are:\r\n\r\n  - Rotor settings\r\n  - Ring settings\r\n  - Plug settings\r\n\r\n## Enigma Settings\r\n\r\n### Rotor Settings\r\n\r\nA typical enigma machine had three rotors (which we are simulating here). Rotors could be set up in any starting position, corresponding to a letter in the alphabet.\r\n\r\nFor example, rotor settings could be `[\"A\", \"A\", \"A\"]` or `[\"B\", \"Q\", \"Z\"]`\r\n\r\nIn our simulation here, these will be represented by the ordinal of the these letters (i.e. `[\"A\", \"A\", \"A\"]` will be `[0, 0, 0]` and `[\"B\", \"Q\", \"Z\"]` will be `[1, 16, 26]`)\r\n\r\n### Ring settings\r\n\r\nRing settings alter the configuration of the rotors to ensure that the same letter is not encrypted the same way twice.\r\n\r\nNormally, everytime a letter was pressed, the far right rotor (the third) would progress one letter in the alphabet. Once it had gone around a full revolution (through all 26 letters) the middle rotor would then advance one letter in the alphabet.\r\n\r\nThis process would continue until the middle rotor had gone around a full revolution, which would advance the left hand rotor one position, and so on and so on through the length of the message\r\n\r\nThe point at which the right rotor made the middle move and the middle made the left move could be changed. These are the ring setting.\r\n\r\nA default ring setting on a three rotor enigma machine would be `[26, 26]`\r\n\r\n### Plug settings\r\n\r\nTo add another extra layer of security, every enigma machine was equipped with a plugboard.\r\n\r\nThis board had ten cables that would switch letter configurations (i.e if \"A\" was plugged into \"B\", then typing \"A\" would use the path normally associated with the letter \"B\")\r\n\r\nAn example plug setting could be `[['P','O'], ['M', 'L'], ['I','U'], ['K','J'], ['N','H'], ['Y','T'], ['G','B'], ['V','F'], ['R','E'], ['D','C']]`\r\n\r\nAgain, for the purposes of this simulation, the ordinals of these letters will be use. So this example ring setting would be\r\n`[[80, 79], [77, 76], [73, 85], [75, 74], [78, 72], [89, 84], [71, 66], [86, 70], [82, 69], [68, 67]]`\r\n\r\nBy convention, no letter is mentioned more than once in plug settings, i.e. `[['A', 'E'], ['E', 'A']]` is not  a valid plug setting\r\n\r\n## Encrypting and Decrypting\r\n\r\n`#TODO`\r\n\r\n## Random Stuff\r\n\r\n- Messages only accept letters of the alphabet (for now)\r\n",
